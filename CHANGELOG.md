# Changelog

## Unreleased — M0

- Added public/private engine-workspace boundary and repository scaffolding.
- Added embedded engine cache and seven stack descriptors.
- Added four JSON Schemas and schema-plus-semantic workspace validation.
- Added `version`, `validate`, and `doctor` with JSON output.
- Added synthetic examples, tests, release automation, and public-data hygiene.
- Replaced the temporary offline adapters with Cobra, `sigs.k8s.io/yaml`, and
  `santhosh-tekuri/jsonschema/v6`; behavioral tests unchanged (ADR 0007).
- Embedded `time/tzdata` so `-trimpath` builds validate timezones without
  system zoneinfo.
